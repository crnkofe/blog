# Python Context Managers demo

These scripts were tested with Python 3.7.3

To run simple sample do:
```bash
python3 context_simple.py ./winequality-red.csv
```

To run full sample do:
```bash
python3 context_demo.py -f ./winequality-red.csv -s ";" 
```

The CSV file is not mine. It was downloaded from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality .
